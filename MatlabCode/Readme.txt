Contains the Matlab code of the corresponding graphics in the paper, and also contains the source code of the Unwinding algorithm. The Unwinding algorithm can not only be used in the analysis of the behavioral signal of the medaka, but in my other research, I have also applied it to the signal filtering of the car's smart air flow meter, and achieved very good results.
